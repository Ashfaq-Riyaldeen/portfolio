**🚀 The site is LIVE:** [ashfaq-riyaldeen.vercel.app](https://ashfaq-riyaldeen.vercel.app) — one task left, and it's all yours: open [/admin](https://ashfaq-riyaldeen.vercel.app/admin) and replace the placeholder projects/certificates with the real thing ([OWNERS_GUIDE.md](./OWNERS_GUIDE.md) shows how).

## Post-launch · 2026-07-11

- [x] Domain renamed to [ashfaq-riyaldeen.vercel.app](https://ashfaq-riyaldeen.vercel.app); `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` updated; sitemap/robots/og fixed
- [x] Google Search Console verified (file in `public/`, never delete) + sitemap submitted; homepage indexed
- [x] **Animation upgrade** — GSAP (ScrollTrigger/SplitText/ScrambleText) layered over motion + Lenis: char-reveal headings site-wide, hero scroll-away parallax + name char intro + role decode cycler, project-cover parallax, velocity-reactive skills marquee, footer reveal, 404 glitch, contact-success drawn checkmark; lazy desktop-only React Three Fiber 3D particle hero (2D canvas fallback on mobile/reduced-motion/weak GPUs)
- [x] **Boot-sequence loading page** — GSAP preloader: terminal lines decode + name signature reveal + 0→100 counter, curtain-up exit that hands off to the hero intro (first-time visitors now actually see it); once per session, no-JS/reduced-motion safe
- [x] **Fix blank page on older iPhones** — Next 16 ships JS requiring Safari 16.4+, so iOS 15 Safari died on a SyntaxError and showed a black page; added `browserslist` (safari 15) so the build transpiles for it, plus CSS fallbacks for `dvh` units and `in oklab` gradients; verified on WebKit 15.4 + modern WebKit + Chromium
- [x] **Scroll-scrub motion** — new `Scrub` primitive (`src/components/motion/scrub.tsx`): movement bound to scroll position, reversible; heading underlines draw themselves in, about portrait/facts drift at different depths, stats/projects/certifications cards shear at alternating speeds, resume banner breathes in, contact columns converge; transform-only, reduced-motion safe, verified on all three engines with no mobile overflow
